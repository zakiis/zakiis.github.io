# Introduction

Zakiis - A public java framework  based on spring boot for enhancing your project or quick start a new project. 

# Quick start

We highly recommend using spring boot 2.x and spring cloud 3.x in your project. If these requirement can't meet, It's safe not using the features provided by Netflix  like Feign, Ribbon.

If your project don't have parent or you are going to create a new project, we recommend you using zakiis-parent as your project parent.
